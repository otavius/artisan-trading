# My Systematic Trading Framework

## Reasons behind building this code

A few years ago I got really into investing in all different types of assets. Penny stocks, options, forex and etc, you name it. I have definitly enjoy learning how the finanical game is played. Fast forword a few years and I can't stand looking at charts all day. Like maybe for a few minutes realisticly (5 minutes max )

| code base          | Description                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **API**            | The Api folder currently holds the keys to working with Oanda API. I created the OandaAPI class in order make request to the API.          |
| **Data**           | Holds a lot of data from Oanda but also recommend getting tick data from another soruce as well.                                           |
| **Exploration**    | In the exploration folder is where I do alot of the testing for strategies and also testing new api functions I create                     |
| **Infrastructure** | This hold my collect data script that download the data need from the pairs that i'm trading                                               |
| **Models**         | I have a instruments.py that models how I want the data to be                                                                              |
| **Simulation**     | This is where I will turn the trading stratgies that I'm testing in the exploration folder into scripts and save them to excel file sheets |
